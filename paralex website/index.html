        <h1>About Frontend</h1>
        <p>Front-end development primarily focuses on user experience. Using the related coding and design techniques,
            you as front-end developers build the elements of an application that are directly accessed by end-users
            with a goal of rendering the entire interface elegant, easy to use, fast, and secure, fostering user
            engagement and interaction.Thanks to the latest design and technology trends geared for the front end,
            you can build increasingly more sophisticated designs and interaction patterns. Simultaneously, however,
            more complexity results, so much so that front-end development has become a specialized field that requires
            deep expertise.</p>

        <h1>What Is Coding</h1>
        <p>Electronic devices like cell phones, laptops, and tablets require code to function properly. Coding allows
            humans to communicate with these devices. Modern technology such as traffic lights, calculators, smart TVs,
            and cars use internal coding systems.Since computers do not communicate like humans, coding acts as a
            translator.
            Code converts human input into numerical sequences that computers understand. Once computers receive these
            messages,
            they complete assigned tasks such as changing font colors or centering an image.Read on to learn about how
            people use
            code to communicate with computers and develop electronic devices, machines, and other technologies.</p>

        <h1>What Is Designing</h1>
        <p>Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and implementing the plan for designing a website
            in a way that is functional and offers a good user experience. User experience is central to the web
            designing process. Websites have an array of elements presented in ways that make them easy to navigate. Web
            designing essentially involves working on every attribute of the website that people interact with, so that
            the website is simple and efficient, allows users to quickly find the information they need, and looks
            visually pleasing. All these factors, when combined, decide how well the website is designed.</p>
