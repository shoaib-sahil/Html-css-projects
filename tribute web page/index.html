                    <h2>About Me:</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hey, I am SHOAIB,</strong> an IIT graduate, and a professional Software Engineer with around 3
                        years ofexperience. If you are a beginner or intermediate who wants to learn programming
                        or a personlooking to transform and scale your business through beautiful-looking websites, you
                        have reached the right place. I have built tons of websites and taught lots of people around the
                        globe how to code and build them from scratch. I developed many web-based projects from simple
                        landing pages to mern applications and nft related websites. I love learning new and better ways
                        to create seamless user experiences with clean, efficient, and scalable code. If you have any
                        questions, feel free to contact
                        me.</p>
